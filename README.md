# Crypto Social Media Playbook
### by @0xbrel · Flow State Weekly

A living reference document covering the content frameworks, 
thread structures, and engagement strategies I've developed 
running @0xbrel and Flow State Weekly — a Nansen-powered 
institutional Bitcoin intelligence newsletter.

Built from 4+ years operating inside crypto Twitter and Web3 
media ecosystems.

## Thread Structures That Drive Engagement

### The "Data vs. Narrative" Thread
Best used when the market narrative is wrong and the data proves it.

Structure:
- Line 1: State the popular belief (the wrong one)
- Line 2: One-line contradiction
- Line 3: "Here's what the data actually shows 🧵"
- Tweets 2–6: On-chain data points, one per tweet
- Final tweet: The real conclusion + CTA

Example opener:
"Everyone is calling this a bear market.
The wallets disagree.
Here's what exchange flows are actually showing 🧵"

---

### The "Most People Miss This" Thread
Best used for educational content targeting mid-level crypto audiences.

Structure:
- Line 1: "Most people look at X"
- Line 2: "Smart money looks at Y"
- Lines 3–7: Bullet breakdown of Y with explanation
- Final line: Engagement CTA ("Save this. You'll need it.")

Example:
"Most people look at price.
Smart money looks at:
→ Exchange flows
→ Stablecoin supply on exchanges
→ Whale wallet behavior
→ Funding rates

Price is the last thing to move.
Everything else tells you it's coming."

### The "Uncomfortable Truth" Single Tweet
Best for high-engagement standalone posts. Short, punchy, slightly contrarian.

Formula: [Common behavior] + [Contrast] + [Implied lesson]

Examples:
"You've been waiting for a dip since $40k.
The whales didn't wait.
The data didn't wait."

"The market is pricing in fear.
The wallets aren't.
Know the difference."

## Engagement Triggers That Work in Crypto Twitter

**1. The Prediction Accountability Post**
Own your wrong calls publicly. Analyze what the data missed.
This builds more trust than 10 correct predictions.

**2. The "Before It Was News" Post**
Reference your own past content when a thesis plays out.
"Called this 3 weeks ago when exchange flows showed..."

**3. The Insider Framing**
Write like you're sharing something most people don't know yet.
Not arrogant — just specific. Specificity signals expertise.

**4. The Reframe**
Take a trending narrative and flip it using one data point.
The contrarian angle with receipts is the highest-performing 
format in crypto media.
